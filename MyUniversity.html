                I'm attending Borough of Manhattan Community College to pursue a career in the field
                of computer science. BMCC has a convenience of location since it's only a 30 minute walk
                for me. It is also known for it's diversity due to students coming from other parts of the world.
                It also has many programs that could be a major help to students such as ASAP.
